	A slave needs to have a directory dedicated to Hudson. Specify the absolute path of this work directory on the slave, 
	such as '/var/hudson' or 'c:\hudson'. This should be a path local to the slave machine.
	
	Typically, there's no need for this path to be visible from the master.</br></br>

	Slaves do not maintain important data (other than active workspaces of projects last built on them), so you can possibly 
	set the slave workspace to a temporary directory if it is ok to lose the latest workspace 
	when the slave is turned off.
